Comment:
DS_3_4.py:
	An array A is said to have a majority element if more than half of the entries in A are exactly the same.  Describe an O(nlogn) divide-and-conquer algorithm that determines whether an array A of n items has a majority element, and if so, returns that item. The only comparison operation allowed on the items is equality. That is, your algorithm can determine whether “A[i] == A[j]” or not in O(1) time, but it cannot, for example, compare the items to sort them, or hash the items into buckets.  Explain why your algorithm takes
O(nlogn) time.

DS_4_4.py:
	Given  an  array  of  numbers X={x1, x2, . . . , xn},  an exchanged  pair in X is  a  pair (xi, xj) such that i < j and xi > xj.  Note that an element xi can be part of up to n−1 exchanged pairs, and that the maximal possible number of exchanged pairs in X is n(n−1)/2,which is achieved if the array is sorted in descending order.  Develop a divide-and-conquer algorithm that counts the number of exchanged pairs in X in O(nlogn) time. Argue why your algorithm is correct, and why your algorithm takes O(nlogn) time.  You can assume that n is a power of two
